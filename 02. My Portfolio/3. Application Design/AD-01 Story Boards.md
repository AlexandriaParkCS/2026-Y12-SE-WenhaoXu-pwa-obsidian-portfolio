**Sign Up Experience**
The Sign Up screen is integral to the experience of a new user. It should be designed to be simple, secure and intuitive, matching industry standards and encouraging people of all ages to use the application.

The sign up screen is presented to a new user from the main page of the application.

The sign up screen follows industry standards, so the username will be limited to a max character limit of 30, the email will be referenced and the password will have minimum requirements. The sign up screen also allows for third-party sign in for more convenient options. The interface is responsive, allowing for users to fix their details in case it does not match the requirements through the use of error messages like "Email is invalid (Not a real email)" or "Password requires 1 number / special character!". The password is also hidden by default but can be viewed by holding down a button in the shape of an eye to ensure privacy in public spaces. 

The sign up screen is designed to be minimalistic so that it will not be difficult to sign in. It is design to reduce cognitive load through the use of minimal elements, and convenient through with the third-party sign in options. Through a visual hierarchy the user is guided from the top to the bottom, and the consistent use of theming reinforces brand identity.

When a user registers successfully, they are brought to the dashboard where they can start visualising their ideas and projects. 

**Whiteboard Creation**

The whiteboard creation screen allows for flexibility. 

The user is presented with multiple options, such as an infinite whiteboard or a whiteboard bound by a specific size. The user will be allowed to choose from set of preset options or create their own customised layouts. Having more options allows for flexibility in visualisations.

The creation screen should not be too complex, while maintaining the ability for a variety in customisation. The screen will allow for users to select more advanced options through a dedicated button.

The whiteboard itself will have many tools that will improve efficiency. There will be tools like the straight line, polygon tools, text, ruler, and more.
