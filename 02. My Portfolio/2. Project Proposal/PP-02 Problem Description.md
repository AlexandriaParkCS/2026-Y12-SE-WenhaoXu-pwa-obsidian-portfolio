Idea: Versatile Digital Whiteboard
Features: Write whenever I have problem with other software.

This project is aimed at solving issues for a variety of people ranging from ages of around 10 until retirement. The goal is to create a digital whiteboard that has a great range of features that are missing, to create a fast and efficient way to express ideas, teach new information or even provide a space for artwork. Currently, existing options are either too slow and complex or too simple, lacking tools for easier and faster visualisations. This project will provide users with multiple whiteboards, easy whiteboard management, drawing tools, smart guidelines and more.
