**Date:** 3 February 2026
**Project:** Virtual Whiteboard (Visual Epicure)
**Module:** Project Proposal

**What I did:**
- Project Proposal
	- Redid PP-02 Problem Description

**Why I did it:**
- PP-02: The previous iteration did not address the problem, and was more of a personal rant on missing features across apps like Google docs, Canva and Photoshop

**Challenges:**
- No major problems

**Next steps:**
- Continue improving the project proposal
	- Write more on PP-02
- Continue working on the application design

**Reflection:** 
- Overall satisfactory
