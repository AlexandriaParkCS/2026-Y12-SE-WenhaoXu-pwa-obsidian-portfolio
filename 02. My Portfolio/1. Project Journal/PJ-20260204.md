**Date:** 4 February 2026
**Project:** Virtual Whiteboard (Visual Epicure)
**Module:** Application Design

**What I did:**
- AD-01 (Story Boards) 
	- Fixing missing 'Sign In' button in AD-01 (Story Boards) 
	- Added an extra storyboard for a mobile screen
	- Added a storyboard for whiteboard creation
	- Described the sign up experience
**Why I did it:**
- It contributes to my design process, outlining a framework for ui later

**Challenges:**
- Describing design ideas, especially the already common conventions and how they affect our likelihood to sign up.

**Next steps:**
- Finish storyboards, and continue with Project Proposal or Application Design modules

**Reflection:** 
Satisfactory.
